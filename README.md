<h1>TypeScript Training Repository</h1>

<h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It allows developers to write and maintain scalable and reliable code by catching errors early in the development process.</p>

<h2>Why Learn TypeScript?</h2>
<p>Learning TypeScript enhances developer productivity and code quality by providing features such as type checking, interfaces, and generics. It enables developers to write more robust and maintainable code, particularly in large-scale applications.</p>

<h2>Main Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Understanding TypeScript syntax, including types, interfaces, and enums.</li>
    <li>Using TypeScript's strict mode to enforce stricter type checking.</li>
    <li>Working with advanced TypeScript features such as generics and decorators.</li>
    <li>Integrating TypeScript into existing JavaScript projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TypeScript:</strong> Superset of JavaScript with static typing.</li>
    <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> JavaScript runtime environment for running TypeScript applications.</li>
    <li><strong>npm or Yarn:</strong> Package managers for installing TypeScript and managing dependencies.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Studio Code:</strong> Code editor with built-in TypeScript support.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these are the main highlights of my TypeScript training, there is much more I've learned and I am still practicing and perfecting my skills. Continuous learning is key!</p>
